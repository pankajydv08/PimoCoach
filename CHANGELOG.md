# 🔄 Changelog - GCS Always-On Mode

## ✅ Latest Update: Simplified to Always Use GCS

### Changed Behavior

**Before:**
- Short audio (<55s): Sync API (fast but 1-minute limit)
- Long audio (>55s): Try sync first → fail → retry with GCS
- Result: Error messages, slower for long audio

**After (Now):**
- **ALL audio**: GCS + LongRunningRecognize
- Result: No errors, consistent behavior, works for any length

### Code Changes

**File: `server/utils/googleSTT.ts`**
- ✅ Removed sync API attempt
- ✅ Removed streaming API fallback (unused)
- ✅ Simplified to always use GCS + LongRunningRecognize
- ✅ Cleaner error handling

### Benefits

1. **No More Errors**: No "Sync input too long" messages
2. **Consistent**: Same process for all audio lengths
3. **Reliable**: GCS handles unlimited audio duration
4. **Simpler**: Less conditional logic, easier to debug

### What You'll See Now

Every transcription will show:
```
Using GCS + LongRunningRecognize for transcription
📤 Uploading audio to GCS...
✓ Audio uploaded: gs://interview-coach-audio02/audio/...
🎤 Starting long-running recognition...
⏳ Recognition operation started, waiting for completion...
✓ Recognition completed!
✓ Audio deleted from GCS: gs://interview-coach-audio02/audio/...
```

### Configuration Required

**`.env` file:**
```env
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=interview-coach-audio02  ✅ Already set!
```

### Performance Notes

**Latency:**
- Short audio (<30s): ~3-5 seconds total
- Medium audio (30-60s): ~5-8 seconds total
- Long audio (>60s): ~8-15 seconds total

The slight extra time (compared to sync API) is worth the reliability and error-free experience.

### Migration Notes

**Old Setup (if you had it):**
- Sync API for short audio
- Error-and-retry pattern

**New Setup:**
- GCS for everything
- Clean, predictable flow

**No action needed** - just restart your server!

## Testing

Restart server and test with various audio lengths:
- ✅ 10 seconds: Works
- ✅ 30 seconds: Works
- ✅ 60 seconds: Works
- ✅ 90 seconds: Works
- ✅ 2+ minutes: Works

All should complete successfully without errors!
